# DPC

Tar analogous utility to work with the BigFile format from Asobo Studio games.

<sup>This repository is a relative of the main [FMTK repository](https://github.com/widberg/fmtk).</sup>

While the tool is named DPC it works with BigFiles from other platforms too.

## Supported Games/Versions

All versions listed have full support. The bold versions are the version that the respective game is equipped to load. Unstable games are games that may be processed by the tool using the `--unsafe` option but do not have a dedicated DPC backend.
